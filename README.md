replay
======
A technology probe built and designed by Maria HÃ¥kansson, Erik Bonadonna and Jung-Hu Sohn, 
out of the Information Science department at Cornell University in summer of 2013.
Replay gives a community of users a space to give away things they don't need or want anymore
in a simple, informal way.


Replay is meant to explore notions of necessity and people' feelings about what things
they really need and make them happy.

Implementation
--------------

Replay is implemented as a Django project, with the models defined
in several custom apps (exchange, stickies, admin_extension), 
project settings in play/settings.py, url patterns in play/urls.py
view controller functions in play/views.py, and html templates in
the templates directory.

### Models ###
Models are stored in a MySQL database, accessed through Django's built in
database interface.

###### Defined in *exchange*:
* _Item_ - stores information about items on the site (who added, when, description, etc.)
* _Notification_ - tracks notifications between users for an item, expire after a set period of time

###### Defined in built-in *contrib.auth*: 
* _User_ - stores passwords, names, email, etc.

###### Defined in *admin_extension*: 
* _Profile_ - extends the User model, storing profile pictures, phone numbers and other information as needed
* _Info_ - stores the text of a few informational pages (about us and contact)

###### Defined in *stickies* :
* _Sticky_ - the stickies on the ask page, providing a discussion/bulletin board for things users are asking for

### Templates ###
Most of the templates are extensions of either base_items.html
or base_community.html, which are both extensions of base.html.

Internal links are formatted as {% url 'views.view_name' %}.

### Static Files ###
Static files (css and site images) are stored in the static directory
here for easy access and version control and symlinked to the public_html 
directory of the server, where django serves them from.User added images are 
stored in the media directory of public_html, but aren't tracked here.
These files are linked to in the templates with {{ STATIC_URL }}
and {{ MEDIA_URL }}

Files used for server deplyment on a shared fcgi hosting environment
are backed up in the server directory.
